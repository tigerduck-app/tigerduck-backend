"""Canonical taxonomy for NTUST bulletins.

Two orthogonal dimensions:
* `CanonicalOrg` (Dim 1, single-valued) — normalized publisher after merging
  synonyms like `教務處教發中心` / `教務處教學發展中心` / `教學發展中心`.
* `ContentTag` (Dim 2, multi-valued) — semantic labels such as `scholarship`,
  `event`, `free_meal`. A single bulletin can carry several.

A subscription rule is `(orgs: set[CanonicalOrg], tags: set[ContentTag], mode)`
where empty set means wildcard on that dimension. See `matcher.rule_hits`.

Enum-definition order is significant: `GET /v2/bulletins/taxonomy` iterates
the enum, so the iOS subscription editor renders the picker in this exact
sequence.
